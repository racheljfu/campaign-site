    <h1>Interneting is easy!</h1>
    <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <strong>This is how you make an unordered list.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>First add a "ul" element.</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't have to be in a certain order</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>This is how to make an ordered list.</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Notice the "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But the list item elements are the same.</li>
        <li>The numbers increment on their own.</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes, you need to draw attention to a <em>particular</em> word or phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other times, you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em>
      </p>

      <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>
