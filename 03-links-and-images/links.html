    <p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>

    <p>
      This page is about links. There are three types of links.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Absolute links</strong>, which you should generally
      use to direct users to a different website. For example,
    <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'target='_blank'>Mozilla
      Developer Network</a>, is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
      <li>Relative links are best for pointing to another file in your website that are in the same
        or deeper folder, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras page</a>.</li>
      <li>Root-relative links are relative to the "root" of the whole site,
        like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
        but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
    </ul>
