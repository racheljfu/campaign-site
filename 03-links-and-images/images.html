    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>
      This page covers common image formats but you may also be looking for <a
      href='links.html'>links</a> and <a href='misc/extras.html'>useful
      extras</a>.
    </p>

<h2>JPGs</h2>
  <p>JPG images are good for photos with lots of gradients.
  </p>

  <img src='images/mochi.jpg' width='75' alt='A mochi ball in a bubble.'/>

<h2>GIFs</h2>
  <p>
    GIFs are good for animations, but are limited in terms of color palette and
    it can be hard to get high levels of detail.
  </p>

  <img src='images/mochi.gif' width='75' alt='A dancing mochi ball.'/>

  <h2>PNGs</h2>
  <p>
    PNGs are good for anything that's not photographs or animations, like icons or
    diagrams. They deal with opacity and color just fine.
  </p>

  <img src='images/mochi.png' width='75' alt='A mochi ball.'/>

  <h2>SVGs</h2>
  <p>
    SVGs are vector-based graphics, so it's a good tool for responsive design.
    They're good for the same uses as PNGs, for them to display consistently
    across browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your image editor.
  </p>

  <img src='images/mochi.svg' width='75' alt='A mochi ball with Bezier handles.'/>

<!-- pixel-based image formats need to be twice as big as you want them to appear on retina displays -->
