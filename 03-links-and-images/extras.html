    <!--Linking to files in a directory above the current file, instead of the same folder or deeper -->
    <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may
   also be interested in <a href='../links.html'>links</a> or
   <a href='../images.html'>images</a>.</p>

  <h2>Character Sets</h2>

  <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>bir</li>
    <li>iki</li>
    <li>üç</li>
    <li>dört</li>
    <li>beş</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
  <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
     should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
  <!--Entities always begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).
  In between, you put a special code that your browser will interpret as a symbol
-->

<p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
   yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
