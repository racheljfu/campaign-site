## My title:
**Rachel's art portfolio**

## Description
My website is somewhat of a portfolio, but I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a professional
portfolio with resum√© and job qualifications on it. It's more of a personal portfolio which holds 
different types of artwork I've made / collected, and it has a short about page (if you click on the 
photo on the homepage) where I describe some basic information about myself. The focus is mainly on the artwork, 
though, as you can see there are three different pages where I display some of my traditional artwork,
photography, and then items I've collected from reuse / thrift stores that I like.
