# Website Portfolio
Rachel Wonder

## My idea:
**A Collection of Creative Works*

## Ideas 
In my website portfolio I don't necessarily want it to be a resume-focused site that only discusses job
qualifications, but rather to show some of the simple creative things I've done that I find worth showing.
For example, I want to show a list of some photos I've taken and then have a short list of description 
of the date/time/subject below it, and then you can scroll through them. Same goes for artworks I've made, 
and essays I've written, for example (the exact content I want to show might change though).

## Website specifics

I want to have a simple home page that briefly describes the website and provides a menu for navigating to
the different types of content, and then each page will have a fixed sidebar with the menu on it and the type of content,
while on the right you can scroll through the actual content itself.
